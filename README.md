# Utility_AI_GDExtension
This repository contains the binaries and example project for the Utility AI GDExtension for Godot Engine.

If you don't know what Utility AI is, here is what Wikipedia says about it:

*"...Utility AI, is a simple but effective way to model behaviours for non-player characters. Using numbers, formulas and scores to rate the relative benefit of possible actions, one can assign utilities to each action. A behaviour can then be selected based on which one scores the highest 'utility'...* - [Wikipedia - Utility system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_system)

If you want the source code, you can find it here: [Utility AI Source Code repository](https://github.com/JarkkoPar/Utility_AI).
