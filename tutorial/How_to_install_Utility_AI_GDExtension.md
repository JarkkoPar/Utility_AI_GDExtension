4. Once the download completes, extract all the files in the zip-file to a folder and open the folder.


5. In the folder you just opened, you will likely see a subfolder named something like `Utility_AI_GDExtension-X.X`, where X.X is the version number of the extension. If so, open that folder and you will find the `addons` folder.


6. To install the extension to your project, copy the addons-folder to your Godot project root folder. 


When you open your Godot project, you should see in your FileSystem tab the `addons` folder and within it the utility_ai extension. The Utility AI nodes should be available when you add new nodes in to your scenes.
